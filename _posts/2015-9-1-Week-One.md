This being my first time taking a course taught by Professor Downing, I didn't quite know what to expect. I had heard good things from past students which is why I enrolled in CS 373.

My initial impression of Professor Downing is very positive. His approach to teaching is unique and engaging. He calls on random students to answer questions which ensures that everyone in the room is paying attention. Downing also uses a (paid) interactive teaching platform called Top Hat for attendance and quizzes. I'm not sure how I feel about Top Hat as most of the features we've used up until now could have been handled with iClickers, but I suppose the UI is nice. Throughout lectures, Downing walks us through Python and JavaScript code snippets and relates everything to industry practices which is great because it allows me to see how I could use certain techniques and it also deters people from asking “what are the practical uses of this” every couple of topics. Lectures cover Python and JavaScript syntax well so its not a problem if you don't already know these two languages. Quizzes aren't too bad if you paid attention in previous classes as the questions come straight from those lectures.

Finally my tip-of-the-week would be read Hacker News. Its a simple social news website run by Y Combinator and articles relevant to computer science and software engineering are posted there daily. Its useful if you want to see what new technologies are being used and even just to find an interesting read.

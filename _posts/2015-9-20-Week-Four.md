title: Week Four

Fourth week of Software Engineering we were introduced to our next assignment, Netflix. Professor Downing walked us through how to approach our new project, taught us how to calculate root mean square error, and set us loose, free to use whatever technique/formula we felt like using to predict Netflix ratings. This was certainly a daunting task considering it took teams of researchers years to achieve a 0.8558 RMSE and I felt like I was very much stumbling in the dark.

Downing also introduced us to some more functional features of Python like list comprehensions, lambdas, map, reduce, zip, generators, and the idea of programming to an interface (make functions as accommodating as possible). This was really fun because we got to try and implement RMSE several different ways using these newly introduced tools and by doing so learned new ways of approaching problems which was an interesting departure from the object oriented mindset that was ingrained by 314. Downing introduced us to laziness in Python provided by generators and how their use can speed up your programs and we got to implement our own version of map.

Tip of the week is to attend the career fair. Not really a new tip to any of the students in Software Engineering considering how much Downing has been emphasizing it, but I thought that maybe if you haven't been paying attention in class and are for some reason reading this entry, I would remind you one more time that the career fair is a great place to talk to companies, get a sense of what it would be like to work there, and figure out what you want to do after graduating.

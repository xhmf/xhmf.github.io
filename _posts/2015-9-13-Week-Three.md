Third week of Software Engineering was cut one day short due to Labor Day which was a welcome break from the gradually increasing onslaught of assignments.

This week Chris Martin, the first of many guest speakers and UTCS/Software Engineering alumnus, showed up to talk about the company he works for, Bloomberg, the sort of work they do, and various technologies his team uses including frameworks like Hadoop and Spark. I really enjoyed his presentation because it introduced us to tools you ordinarily wouldn't learn about in a classroom setting. Professor Downing also covered exceptions in Python and JavaScript and went over their advantage over asserts. This topic was covered in typical Downing style by first letting the class come up with ideas on how to indicate to the function caller that something unexpected had happened (examples from class included returning booleans, setting some global variable, modifying some mutable object passed into the function), gradually improving on those ideas, and then introducing the proper way to handle exceptions with try-except blocks in Python and try-catch blocks in JavaScript. Also covered was Python's try-except-else-finally block which at first was confusing, but Downing walked us through several examples which clarified everything.

Tip-of-the-week is to get started early on projects. The seemingly easy Collatz assignment ended up taking a lot more time than I had anticipated due to the various requirements that needed to be fulfilled. With that in mind I can more accurately estimate time to completion and plan accordingly for the upcoming Netflix project.
